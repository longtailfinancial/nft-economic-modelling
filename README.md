# NFT Economic Modelling
Repository for researching NFT economic models.

The primary purpose of this research is to model the ability for a collective 
to raise funds through the production and sale of collectible art NFTs. 

This research is evidently requested by many different parties throughout web3.
Longtail Financial has now been a successful advisor partner for the Future
Thinkers Podcast Network which raised over $850K to finance the purchasing of
land towards developing a 'regenerative living laboratory' smart village in
British Columbia, Canada.

Kid Opal, an emerging decentralized art, design, and campaign agency is now
investigating the process of NFT sales for bootstrapping eco initiatives,
social justice movements, and socio-economic reform movements. 

Most notably, LTF is a founding partner of the Crypto Commons to Save the Bees
(CCSB), which provides a phase I NFT art sale to bootstrap funds towards
creating a global solution to save the bees using ecological solutions, and to
continue to fund the non-for-profit, Center for Ecological Consciousness, which
will be a joint research laboratory and think tank for bringing ecological
solutions to the forefront of political, social, and economic challenges that
we face as a commons.
